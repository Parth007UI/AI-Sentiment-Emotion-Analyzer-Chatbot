#AI Sentiment & Emotion Analyzer Chatbot

## Project Overview
The **Emotion Detection Chatbot** is an AI-powered application that classifies emotions from user input in real-time. The system utilizes a pre-trained transformer model (DistilRoBERTa) for natural language processing (NLP) and emotion analysis. It helps businesses, healthcare providers, and other organizations understand user sentiments by detecting emotions such as joy, anger, sadness, surprise, and more.

## Features
- **Real-Time Emotion Detection**: Detects emotions from user input instantly.
- **Model Accuracy**: Uses a fine-tuned DistilRoBERTa model for classification with high accuracy.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Can be deployed using platforms like Streamlit for easy interaction.
- **Scalable**: Can be enhanced to support voice-based emotion detection in the future.

## Technology Stack
- **Python**: Programming language used for developing the chatbot.
- **Transformers**: Hugging Face library for pre-trained NLP models.
- **TensorFlow/PyTorch**: Frameworks used for training and fine-tuning the model.
- **Streamlit**: For building a real-time, interactive interface.
- **Pandas/NumPy**: For data handling and processing.

## Dashboard
The chatbot interface is designed to provide a simple, user-friendly dashboard. On the dashboard, users can input text, and the system will display:
- The **detected emotion** (e.g., joy, sadness, anger).
- The **confidence score** of the detected emotion (in percentage).
- **Real-time feedback** based on user inputs to enhance the overall user experience.

The dashboard can be accessed through a Streamlit interface, providing real-time emotion analysis as users interact with the chatbot.
